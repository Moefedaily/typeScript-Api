# TypeScript & JSONPlaceholder API Project

This project shows how to work with a public API using TypeScript. We fetch user data and their posts from JSONPlaceholder and display them in the console.

## What does this project do?

- Gets user information from a public API
- Shows details about each user
- Fetches all posts written by each user
- Displays the posts with its corrosponding user in a readable format

## How to run the project

1. **`Make sure you have Node.js installed`**
2. Clone this repository
3. Install the packages: `npm install`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Run it: `npm start`

## Project structure

The code is organized into different parts:

- **interfaces**: Defines what our data looks like
- **services**: Handles getting data from the API
- **util**: Contains functions to display information
- **main**: Brings everything together

## API information

I'm using the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) which provides:

- User data
- Posts by each user

Made with ❤️ and TypeScript
